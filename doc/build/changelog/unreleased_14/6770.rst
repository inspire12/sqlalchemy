    Fixed issue where type-specific bound parameter handlers would not be
    called upon in the case of using the :meth:`_sql.Insert.values` method with
    the Python ``None`` value; in particular, this would be noticed when using
    the :class:`_types.JSON` datatype as well as related PostgreSQL specific
    types such as :class:`_postgresql.JSONB` which would fail to encode the
    Python ``None`` value into JSON null, however the issue was generalized to
    any bound parameter handler in conjunction with this specific method of
    :class:`_sql.Insert`.
