    Fixed an issue where clearing of mappers during things like test suite
    teardowns could cause a "dictionary changed size" warning during garbage
    collection, due to iteration of a weak-referencing dictionary. A ``list()``
    has been applied to prevent concurrent GC from affecting this operation.
